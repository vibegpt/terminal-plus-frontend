# Terminal+ MVP Status Update

_Last updated: 2025-05-06_

## üö¶ Project Status Overview

Terminal+ is a mobile-first web application designed to transform "dead time" in international airport terminals into a personalized, mood-driven experience. The MVP is well underway, with core flows and features implemented, but a few areas remain to be completed or refined.

## ‚úÖ What's Implemented

### Core Flows
- **Journey Planning:** Users can plan a journey by entering departure, destination, flight number, date, layovers, and select a "vibe" (Relax, Explore, Work, Quick).
- **Guide View:** After planning, users are shown personalized amenity recommendations in the terminal, filtered by their selected vibe and journey context.
- **Explore Terminal:** Users can explore terminals and get recommendations by airport code, terminal, and vibe, without planning a full journey.
- **Journey History:** Users can view, revisit, and delete previously planned journeys (stored locally).
- **Vibe Manager Chat:** An AI-powered chat assistant adapts its tone and suggestions to the user's mood and journey context.
- **Amenity Details:** Users can view detailed information about terminal amenities.
- **Multi-Airport Support:** Early support for multi-airport journeys and layovers.
- **Responsive UI:** Mobile-first design with modern UI components and dark mode.

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router.
- **Backend:** Supabase (DB, Auth, Edge Functions).
- **Hosting:** Vercel.
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI for Vibe Manager chat.
- **Data:** Static amenity data for Sydney Airport (SYD) and others.

### Data & Recommendations
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Amenity suggestions are filtered by vibe, time available, and terminal.
- **Vibe Modes:** Relax, Explore, Work, Quick, Comfort.
- **Recommendation Engine:** Modular, with scoring for time, vibe, transitions, and user preferences.

## üü° What's In Progress / Missing for MVP

### Features
- **Crowd/Queue Data:** Currently a placeholder; no real-time crowd or queue data for amenities.
- **User Authentication:** Supabase Auth is set up, but user-specific journeys/history are not yet linked to authenticated users (local storage only).
- **Edge Functions:** Only `saveJourney` is implemented; `getJourneys` and other server-side logic are pending.
- **Transit Guide:** Placeholder for transit airport amenities; not yet implemented.
- **Manual Terminal Selection:** If terminal cannot be auto-detected, manual selection is not fully implemented in the journey planner.
- **Amenity Location Mapping:** Amenity coordinates and walking times are static or placeholder values.
- **Multi-Airport Journey:** UI exists, but deeper logic and data for multi-airport flows are limited.
- **Data Coverage:** Amenity data is static and limited to a few airports/terminals.

### UI/UX
- **Polish & Error Handling:** Some flows (e.g., missing data, network errors) need more robust handling.
- **Accessibility:** Needs review for a11y best practices.
- **Onboarding/Help:** No onboarding or help screens for new users.

## üìù Next Steps to MVP

1. **Implement Real-Time Crowd Data:** Integrate with a data source or provide a basic simulation for amenity crowd levels.
2. **User Authentication & Cloud Sync:** Link journeys to authenticated users and enable cloud sync/history.
3. **Transit Guide Page:** Build out the transit guide for layover airports.
4. **Manual Terminal Selection:** Add a step for users to manually select a terminal if not auto-detected.
5. **Improve Amenity Data:** Expand amenity data coverage and add real coordinates for better recommendations.
6. **Edge Functions:** Implement `getJourneys` and other backend logic for user data retrieval.
7. **UI Polish:** Refine error states, loading indicators, and add onboarding/help.
8. **Testing & QA:** End-to-end testing of all flows on mobile and desktop.

## üìä MVP Readiness Estimate

- **Core journey planning and recommendations:** 80% complete
- **Vibe Manager and chat:** 90% complete
- **Explore terminal flow:** 90% complete
- **User auth/cloud sync:** 30% complete
- **Crowd/queue data:** 0% (placeholder)
- **Transit/layover support:** 30% (UI only)
- **Data coverage:** 50% (SYD only, static)
- **UI/UX polish:** 60%

**Estimated MVP completion:** ~2-3 weeks of focused work, depending on data and backend integration.

## üèÅ Summary

Terminal+ MVP is in an advanced prototype stage. The core user journey is implemented and functional, but several integrations (auth, real-time data, backend sync) and polish items remain before a public MVP launch.
